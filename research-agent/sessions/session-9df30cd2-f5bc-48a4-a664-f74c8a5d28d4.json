This development addresses the long-standing challenge of quantum error correction, a crucial step towards practical, large-scale quantum computation. The system demonstrated uses 448 atomic quantum bits and incorporates mechanisms like quantum teleportation.\n\n**Journals and Repositories:**\n\n*   **Journal of Quantum Computing:** This open-access journal publishes cutting-edge research in quantum computing and information science.
