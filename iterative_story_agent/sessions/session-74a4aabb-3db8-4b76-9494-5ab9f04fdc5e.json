            "text": "Eli had grown up with the roar of the weekend crowd echoing through his bedroom television. Every Saturday, the lens captured the bruised helmets, the thundering collision of bodies, the smell of damp earth that seemed to seep into his skin even from miles away. He memorized the way the captain’s shoulders squared before a charge, the flash of a wing’s sprint, and the way the ball slipped from a teammate’s grasp in a perfect, spiraling arc. Eli’s heart beat a little faster each time another try was scored; he felt a quiet ache of longing, a childish prayer that one day he might feel the weight of the oval in his own hands.\n\nThat day finally arrived when his older brother, Max, shouted across the line‑up of sweaty teenagers. “Hey, Eli! We need a sub for the forward pack. You in?” Eli’s throat tightened. The night before, he had stared at his own reflection, rehearsing the words he’d say to the coach. “I’m ready,” he whispered, even though his stomach knotted with anxiety. He imagined the sting of mud in his boots, the rough scrape of grass against his shins, and the surge of belonging that would burst through his chest the moment the whistle blew.\n\nThe field was a patchwork of vivid green and brown, the grass damp from an early drizzle that left each blade slick like a glossy carpet. The crowd’s chatter rose and fell like a tide, punctuated by the occasional gasp when a player dove for a line‑out. Eli’s fingers twitched around the strap of his borrowed boots, feeling the cold, gritty mud cling to the leather. Max gave him a quick, reassuring grin, his brow furrowed with a mixture of excitement and worry. “Just watch the ball, kid. Trust your instincts,” he muttered, clapping Eli on the shoulder.\n\nWhen the ball was tossed high into the air, Eli felt his breath catch. The oval glittered under the low‑sunlight before spiraling down toward him. For a heartbeat, time slowed; the world narrowed to the hiss of wind and the distant roar of the crowd. He lunged, heart hammering, his mind replaying every highlight reel he’d ever watched. The moment his palms brushed the smooth leather, a surge of adrenaline pushed away the fear—until his foot slipped on the slick patch of turf. The world tipped, and he hit the ground with a brutal, sudden thud that seemed to echo louder than the crowd’s cheers.\n\nPain ripped up his left ankle, a sharp fire that shot up his shin. The whistle screeched, and the game fell silent for a breath. Players swarmed, their faces a blur of concern. Max was the first to reach him, his expression shifting from pride to panic. “Eli! You alright? I’m sorry—I should’ve…,” he started, voice cracking. The trainer’s hands were firm but gentle as he examined the swelling, his eyes flicking over the torn skin and the twisted joint. “It’s a sprain, probably a bad one,” he said, “You’ll need to rest and ice it for a while.”\n\nThe medics lifted Eli onto a stretcher, the canvas humming with the weight of his limp. As they carried him off the field, his vision caught the flickering light of the stadium’s floodlights, and a promise rose in his throat, hoarse from the pain: “Next time, I’ll be ready.”\n\n---\n\nLater that evening, Eli lay on his couch, the ankle swathed in a fresh bandage, a cold pack humming against the swelling. The television was off; the only sound was the faint ticking of the kitchen clock. Max sat beside him, a half‑eaten sandwich untouched on the coffee table.\n\n“I thought I could handle it,” Eli said, his voice low. “I wanted to be part of it… I guess I wanted to prove something.”\n\nMax’s eyes softened. “You didn’t have to prove anything, Eli. Watching was already part of who you are. But you’re brave, stepping onto that field. It’s okay to get knocked down. What matters is getting back up.”\n\nThe trainer knocked on the door, a clipboard in hand. “Eli, I’ve got your x‑ray here,” he said, sliding the thin film across the coffee table. “It’s a Grade 2 sprain—painful, but with proper rehab you’ll be back in a couple of months. I’ll give you a set of exercises. No more rushing onto the pitch until you’re ready, okay?”\n\nEli nodded, feeling a strange mixture of disappointment and relief. He imagined the next time he’d stand on the grass, this time with stronger ankles and a steadier breath. Max reached over, squeezed his shoulder, and whispered, “We’ll take it slow. We’ll watch the games together, and when you’re ready, we’ll get you on that field again. This time, you’ll know exactly how the mud feels under your boots.”\n\nThe night settled around them, the house quiet except for the occasional rustle of leaves outside. Eli stared at the bandaged ankle, the faint throb a reminder of his first fall. Yet beneath the ache, a spark of determination glowed brighter than any stadium light. He closed his eyes, picturing the next game, the sound of the crowd, the smell of fresh-cut grass, and felt, for the first time, that the injury was not an end but a beginning."
