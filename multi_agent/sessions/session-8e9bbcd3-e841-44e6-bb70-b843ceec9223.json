Handheld gaming PCs continue to evolve, offering more powerful hardware capable of running high-end PC games. The development of dual GPU setups in handhelds is being explored to significantly boost performance. Cloud gaming will play an even larger role, allowing access to extensive game libraries without the need for local storage.\n\nCompanies like Nintendo are continuing to innovate with devices like the Switch 2, which promises enhanced visuals and performance. There are also indications that Sony and Xbox may enter or expand their presence in the handheld market, potentially inspired by the success of PC handhelds. The retro handheld scene is also thriving, with companies releasing increasingly capable and affordable devices for emulating older game consoles. Emerging technologies like VR and AR integration are also being explored for future handheld gaming experiences. The market is expected to see continued innovation in ergonomic designs, battery life, and connectivity.",
    "final_summary": "- **From simple gadgets to sophisticated hybrids:** Handheld gaming began with single‑game devices in the 1970s, gained massive popularity with Nintendo’s durable Game Boy (1989), and evolved into dual‑screen, touchscreen, and hybrid consoles like the DS (2004) and Switch (2017), culminating in powerful PC‑based handhelds (Steam Deck 2022, Asus ROG Ally & Lenovo Legion Go 2025).  \n- **Key technological milestones:** Interchangeable cartridges (Microvision, 1979), color backlit screens (Atari Lynx, 1989), dual screens & touch (Nintendo DS, 2004), glasses‑free 3D (3DS, 2011), high‑end graphics & multimedia (PSP/Vita), and upcoming features such as larger OLED displays, 4K docked output, and 120 Hz handheld performance (Switch 2, 2025).  \n- **Strong market growth and consumer preferences:** About 65 % of gamers favor handhelds for portability; 61 % want multifunction devices with streaming/hybrid capabilities, and 47 % prioritize cloud gaming. Forecasts estimate the market to rise from ~$4.2 B (2024) to $5.3 B (2034) (CAGR 2.4 %) – with some projections seeing up to $35 B by 2034 (CAGR 13.8 %).  \n- **Future directions:** Handhelds will push higher performance (dual‑GPU designs, PC‑grade specs), deeper cloud‑gaming integration, and novel form factors, while retro‑style devices and emerging VR/AR features will expand the ecosystem. Nintendo, Sony, and potentially Xbox are poised to compete in this rapidly innovating space."

                "result": "- **From simple gadgets to sophisticated hybrids:** Handheld gaming began with single‑game devices in the 1970s, gained massive popularity with Nintendo’s durable Game Boy (1989), and evolved into dual‑screen, touchscreen, and hybrid consoles like the DS (2004) and Switch (2017), culminating in powerful PC‑based handhelds (Steam Deck 2022, Asus ROG Ally & Lenovo Legion Go 2025).  \n- **Key technological milestones:** Interchangeable cartridges (Microvision, 1979), color backlit screens (Atari Lynx, 1989), dual screens & touch (Nintendo DS, 2004), glasses‑free 3D (3DS, 2011), high‑end graphics & multimedia (PSP/Vita), and upcoming features such as larger OLED displays, 4K docked output, and 120 Hz handheld performance (Switch 2, 2025).  \n- **Strong market growth and consumer preferences:** About 65 % of gamers favor handhelds for portability; 61 % want multifunction devices with streaming/hybrid capabilities, and 47 % prioritize cloud gaming. Forecasts estimate the market to rise from ~$4.2 B (2024) to $5.3 B (2034) (CAGR 2.4 %) – with some projections seeing up to $35 B by 2034 (CAGR 13.8 %).  \n- **Future directions:** Handhelds will push higher performance (dual‑GPU designs, PC‑grade specs), deeper cloud‑gaming integration, and novel form factors, while retro‑style devices and emerging VR/AR features will expand the ecosystem. Nintendo, Sony, and potentially Xbox are poised to compete in this rapidly innovating space."
